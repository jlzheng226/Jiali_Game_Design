                <p>The Legend of Zelda, a renowned game developed by Nintendo and first released in 1986, has captivated players for decades... For this remake project, I took on the design of the majority of those iconic dungeon enemies, including the formidable Aquamentus, the swift Keese, the elusive Wallmaster and so on — creatures beloved by fans of the series. A key responsibility of mine was studying their movements in detail to faithfully recreate their behavior. I also developed a system to track the health and attack power of both enemies and Link, ensuring balanced gameplay. Additionally, I contributed to the design of various weapons, enhancing the combat experience.</p>

                <p>In addition to recreating the original gameplay, my teammate and I created a new level where we fought enemies at the bottom of the sea through returnee mounts. I designed the movement of the enemies of the sea and the turtles.</p>
